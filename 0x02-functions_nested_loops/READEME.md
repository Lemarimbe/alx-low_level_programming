# C - Functions, nested loops
As a student, I have learned about nested loops for iterating over data in a structured way and functions for writing reusable blocks of code with specific input parameters and return values. I also learned the difference between function declarations and definitions, and how to use prototypes. Variables in a program have a scope, and there are gcc flags like -Wall, -Werror, -pedantic, -Wextra, and -std=gnu89 that set specific options for the GNU Compiler Collection. Additionally, I learned about header files and how to include them in my code to gain access to declarations of functions and objects already defined in other libraries or modules.
